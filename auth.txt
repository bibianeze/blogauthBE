What is Authentication?
Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is.

It answers the question:
 “Are you really who you say you are?”


 Example: When you log into Facebook with your email and password, Facebook checks if you're a registered user and if your password is correct. If yes — you're authenticated.

 we have many ways in which an app can be authenticated. lets look at each one by one:
1. cookie-based Authentication
2. token-based Authentication
3. third-party access (OAuth)


token-based Authentication: when a user tries to register in a website, they check if the credentials provided match, and if it does, they generate a token for the user that will be used to check if other things. 
token-based authentication is a method where the server issues a token (usually a JWT) to the user after successful login. This token is then used to verify the user's identity for each request to protected routes — without storing session info on the server.



 Common Tool: JWT (JSON Web Token)
A JWT is a compact, encoded token that contains user information and is signed using a secret key.

A typical JWT looks like this:


eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.
eyJpZCI6IjEyMzQiLCJlbWFpbCI6InVzZXJAZ21haWwuY29tIn0.
F1dZbNz4TYoKXENdNlCy0p1cI5qpvn6A1r3qL9Lhwl4


It has 3 parts:

Header: Info about the token (e.g., algorithm used)

Payload: Actual data (e.g., user id, role)

Signature: To verify that the token wasn’t tampered with
